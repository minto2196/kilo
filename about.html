  <div class="aboutme-box">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    I completed my schooling in India—more specifically, in Kerala, a place that shaped my early values and ambitions.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    My higher education journey took me to Chennai, where I earned a B.Sc. in Nautical Science from the Academy of Maritime Education and Training. Life there was intense—remolded through early morning physical training and late-night musters, I developed resilience, discipline, and a strong work ethic.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    Academically, I was trained as a jack of all trades, gaining hands-on experience in navigation, ship stability, and a range of maritime skills—though I’d modestly say I am a master of none. This broad foundation allowed me to approach problems with a versatile mindset.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    During my final semester, I initiated and completed a self-motivated individual project, demonstrating my ability to take ownership, innovate, and deliver results independently.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
  As part of my academic journey, I designed and constructed a fully functional miniature model ship—an experience that blended mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development into one cohesive project.
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 1.07rem; color: #495866; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 18px; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li><strong>Mechanical Fabrication:</strong> Personally handled the entire ship assembly, including complex gas and arc welding of the frame and critical components. This hands-on approach gave me a deep understanding of both structural integrity and precision engineering.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated Electronics:</strong> The model ship is powered by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller (programmed in C++) and NODEMCU 1MB, allowing for advanced automation and remote connectivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Wireless Control:</strong> Developed a control system accessible via Wi-Fi, with a bespoke control panel built using a locally hosted website (HTML & CSS). This interface provides real-time command and monitoring capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 1.07rem; color: #495866; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <strong>Key Features:</strong>
  <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0 20px;">
    <li>Precise speed control</li>
    <li>Forward and astern movement</li>
    <li>Accurate direction steering</li>
    <li>Navigation lights and signaling</li>
    <li>Stability management system</li>
    <li>Three functional cargo tanks equipped with pumps for loading and discharge simulation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 1.07rem; color: #34495e; margin-top: 14px;">
  This project was a true culmination of my multidisciplinary skills—blending shipbuilding, electronics, software, and automation. The end result was a robust, remotely controlled ship model that effectively simulates real-world operations on a miniature scale.
</p>

  
  <div style="margin-top: 24px;">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/oeFY7eRdh3Y?si=_214Uedant_7HMY9" target="_blank" style="background: #2563eb; color: #fff; padding: 12px 28px; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.05rem; transition: background 0.18s;">Miniature Model Ship Building – New Castle Project</a>
  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    What made this project particularly challenging was that software development had never been part of my formal education. Creating the control panel, writing HTML and CSS, and handling coding tasks were all entirely self-taught—these subjects were not covered in my college curriculum, and tools like ChatGPT simply did not exist in 2019. Every aspect of the software, from concept to execution, required perseverance, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from scratch.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    Despite these hurdles, I never let academic grades or the lack of a perfect CGPA define my capabilities. Instead, I focused on cultivating strong discipline and time management skills—qualities honed through my college experiences—which enabled me to consistently deliver on complex projects and adapt quickly to new challenges.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    All this hard work and determination eventually paid off when I secured a placement as a deck cadet with a leading Japan-based ship management company. This opportunity allowed me to put my academic learning and practical skills to the test in a real-world maritime environment, launching my professional journey in the shipping industry.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    During my tenure, I sailed on two merchant ships for the company—first on an oil/chemical carrier and then on a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC). Each voyage was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to put my academic knowledge into real-world practice. Working alongside a multinational crew, I quickly became adaptable, thriving amidst constantly changing weather conditions and managing the unique challenges of life at sea, including isolation and long stretches away from shore.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    After completing my second contract, I made the decision to step away from a career in the Merchant Navy, seeking new directions and challenges beyond the horizon.
  </p>
   <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    As a result of my desire to pursue new horizons, I decided to move to Germany to further my education by studying for a master’s degree in meteorology at Leipzig University. While preparing my paperwork and transitioning to this new chapter, I began developing a project focused on slowing climate change through innovative renewable energy solutions. Step by step, I dedicated myself to the planning and realization of this initiative, applying both my technical and problem-solving skills in a new and meaningful context.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    My journey—spanning rigorous maritime training, hands-on engineering projects, real-world experience at sea, and now advanced studies in meteorology—has shaped me into a resilient and innovative problem-solver. I have consistently transformed challenges into opportunities for growth, bringing together practical skills and a passion for impactful solutions.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #34495e;">
    Today, I am channeling this unique blend of expertise into pioneering renewable energy solutions designed to address some of our most urgent environmental challenges. I invite forward-thinking investors to join me on this journey—not only to support an ambitious project, but to make a tangible difference for a sustainable future. Together, we can turn ideas into action and drive meaningful change.
